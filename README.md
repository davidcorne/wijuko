This is a repo for some utilites for making/solving Wijuko puzzles.

## What is a Wijuko puzzle?

I came accross them in [The i Book of Number Puzzles](https://www.clarity-media.co.uk/shoppage.php?id=the-i-book-of-number-puzzles#:~:text=There%20are%20100%20puzzles%20included,symbols%20of%20value%20and%20wijuko.), they are a 3x3 grid. You need to place the numbers 1-9 once in the grid, obeying the sums between pairs of squares.
